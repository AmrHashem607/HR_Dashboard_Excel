ðŸš€ Excited to share my new HR Dashboard Project created using Microsoft Excel!

In this project, I focused on analyzing employee data in a simple and practical way to provide clearer insights that support management in making better data-driven decisions.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights from the Dashboard:

Skills distribution (Communication, Design, Excel, Management, Python).

Employee distribution by gender (Male/Female).

Age classification and Age Ranges.

Salaries by job titles.

Employee distribution across regions and work locations (Head Office, Branch, Remote).

Performance comparison (Performance Rating).

Employment status (Full-time, Part-time, Contract).

ðŸ’¡ Main Objective:
To provide a comprehensive overview of the companyâ€™s human resources and simplify the decision-making process based on data.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting).
